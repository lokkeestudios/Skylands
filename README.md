**Skylands** is an upcoming open-source System, with all sorts of RPG related functionalities.

The main goal of this System is to make it as easy as possible for people to create their own RPGs within Minecraft.
If you look at it this way, Skylands is a toolbox that contains all the tools, required for a successful RPG.
At least that is the idea behind it.

For getting started, check out the fancy [documentation](https://github.com/lokkeestudios/Skylands/wiki)
